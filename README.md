# dots
Dotfiles managed by [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) and [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).  
Work only on distro linux including the installer: ( tested on a fresh install of Gentoo, Archlinux, Void and Debian )  
+ `emerge`: Gentoo, Pentoo, Funtoo.
+ `pacman`: Archlinux, Manjaro, Antergos, ArchBang,...
+ `apt-get`: Debian, Kali, etc...
+ `xbps-install`: Voidlinux. Tested on a clean install of the [rootfs-glibc](https://voidlinux.org/download/) and [rootfs-musl](https://voidlinux.org/download/).

Why i switch on chezmoi?
+ Even with GNU/Stow, i have to modify a lot of files each time i install/reinstall a new system, i start hating this !
+ Template are great.
+ Possibility of encrypt files.
+ Install and updates are easy.

## Requirements
You need to install [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io) with additionnal packages (`sudo vim`).  
With `emerge` (gentoo):

    # emerge -av sudo vim
    $ curl -sfL https://git.io/chezmoi | sh

With `pacman` (arch,...):

    # pacman -S chezmoi sudo vim

With `apt-get` (debian,...)

    # apt-get install sudo vim
    # wget -cv https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/releases/download/v2.9.4/chezmoi_2.9.4_linux_amd64.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i chezmoi_2.9.4_linux_amd64.deb

For `voidlinux`:

    # xbps-install chezmoi sudo

`sudo`, your user should have permission to install packages:

    # EDITOR="vim" visudo
    <username> ALL=(ALL) ALL

If you have create your first user recently (via: `useradd -m -G users,wheel,audio,video <username>`), logout and back to initialize his environment correctly.
    
## Install
Only 4 little steps here

### Clone this repo

    $ chezmoi init https://github.com/szorfein/dots.git

### Config
Edit the config file with your favorite text editor.

    $ EDITOR="vim" chezmoi edit-config

You can change for example in `data.system`:

    [data.system]
      sound = "pulseaudio"

It will install firefox rather than brave-bin and modify a lot of things during the install.  

### Apply
`apply` will install all the dependencies and add files to your $HOME.

    $ chezmoi apply

## Update
From time to time, start the update simply with:

    $ chezmoi diff
    $ chezmoi update

## Final settings
If you have not yet configure X, change the keyboard layout like this:

    $ localectl list-x11-keymap-layouts | grep fr
    $ sudo localectl set-x11-keymap fr

For emacs, when the installation is terminated, you have to manually install the package [all-the-icons](https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el#installing-fonts) like this, start `emacs` and:

    M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts
